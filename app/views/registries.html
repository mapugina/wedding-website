  <h2>A Plea</h2>
  Crystal and Michael are an established couple. They have many of the things
  that couples often need when starting their life together. For the past few
  months Michael <i>might</i> have been dying from stress about what this
  wedding is going to cost. Gifts of money would be greatly appreciated.
